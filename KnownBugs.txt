Known Bugs:

FIXED//Every time you click for reinforcement, the AIs will all claim a country, even if you didn't actually claim one yet
FIXED//-When attacking, you are capable of leaving ZERO units on your old country

FIXED (we think)//Weird Deployment bug where user has 0 units to deploy (The fuck, amirite???)
FIXED (we think) Just ran into a bug where I am now playing as each AI, they aren't skipping to the human player??
MAYBE FIXED//-After removing losing players, it seems that the ArrayList might resort, but I think I know what the problem is -DT
                -This bug also breaks the endgame print screen, but I think I know how to fix it -DT
-Default mode cant find faction (not important as default mode probably wont be in final release)



--TODO--
1. fix attacking so that it works correctly -DONE
2. implement saving/loading a game - DONE
3. fix GUI so that card trade button can only be pressed before deploy phase
4. find a way for users to select cards to redeem
5. force players to redeem cards if they have 5 cards
If there's time:
6. Allow pause of music on splash screen


Brainstorming elements needed to be saved/loaded when ending/starting a game:

- Game
- Player array
- Map 
- Deck
-
